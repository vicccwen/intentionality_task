# Randomness Perception Experiment
## Overview
This project hosts a web-based psychological experiment designed for participants to act as space rescuers. Participants are tasked with analyzing radio transmission sequences to distinguish between natural phenomena and human-generated signals. The experiment utilizes the jsPsych library to present the stimuli and collect responses.

## Features
Display of randomized scenarios based on a space rescue theme.
Collection of demographic data from participants.
Presentation of radio wave sequences for participants to rate their randomness.
Data collection in CSV format for easy analysis.
